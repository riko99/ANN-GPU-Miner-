# ANN-GPU-Miner

This is a beta release Head miner of the most optimized miner for GPUs running on both Nvidia GPU and AMD, including older versions.

Features

-Our software has an easy to use GUI and command line interface. Head is supported only by Windows, Linux is planned to be added in the near future as soon as the work on the internal structure of the miner is finished

-Since there are many features disabled to achieve the highest efficiency and lowest power consumption , attention is focused on achieving the best p[/size]erformance of the GPU.

-List of available GPUs for mining

-This mining miner supports up to 8 GPUs and is ready to work in Nvidia+AMD pairs regardless of their version. Automatically defining their model.

-Simplified interface reports hash rates, accepted and invalid shares

-GPU monitoring for temperature, fan speed, and power usage


-Support of 5 most popular algorithms and optimized work under these algorithms.At the moment it :
